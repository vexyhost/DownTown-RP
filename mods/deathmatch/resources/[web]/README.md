Resources
============
Resources are a key part of [Multi Theft Auto](https://github.com/multitheftauto). A resource is essentially a folder or zip file that contains a collection of files - including essential script and content files, plus a meta file that describes how the resource should be loaded - and runs on a Multi Theft Auto dedicated server.

A resource can be seen as being partly equivalent to a program running in an operating system - it can be started and stopped, and multiple resources can run at once. Its worth remember though, that unlike programs on an operating system, there is no multi-tasking between resources. Resources generally contain content and Lua scripts for game modes, user interfaces and other tasks affecting the players that are connected to the dedicated server on which the resources are running.

This project maintains a list of up-to-date resources that come with Multi Theft Auto. These can be checked out by anyone that wishes to run a dedicated server with the latest resources.

For a collection of user created resources, head over to our [Community](https://community.mtasa.com) web page which serves as a place for hosting our community's resources.
